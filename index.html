“The Anand-ICE ecosystem is creating future global technocrats and world-thinkers, and incubating tomorrow’s business leaders. Our graduating students design their own career path, move ahead and vibrate the world”.

FROM THE OFFICE OF
THE CHAIRMAN

Falling in the AICTE approved college list, Anand International College of Engineering was envisioned with a very clear and singular objective of instituting a symbolic institution for quality education. Our deep value processes have made Anand-ICE synonymous for characteristic learning.

Anand-ICE distinguishes through state-of-the-art infrastructure, international quality teaching pedagogies, excellent nurturing environment for learning and thinking; and further magnifies through intel fraternity.  Anand-ICE’s pursuance in transforming students into world engineers and leaders and thus emerging as the institution of choice for Z-generation students of calibre is one of the goals of the institute. Our continual endeavour to offer the best international facilities and learning practices ensure our students be more than engineers and business leaders.

Promising and educated youth are the soul of every great society and the nation. Our India, tomorrow’s leading nation, only needs to be educated well through contemporary international processes and innovative practices. We firmly believe, every student is thought-seed and carrying latent talent of becoming tomorrow’s great humane leader, if nurtured well. We, at Anand-ICE are working today for nurturing all of our students well, so that each one’s talent grow proficiently and shaped efficiently to ensure that tomorrow’s India realises its full potential to a great nation and can vibrate the world.

We believe, we are creating tomorrow’s complete human leaders, who understand well that everything emerges from and integrates into a greater humanity; who also know, the best for all to work towards the common universal values in their individual and collective capacities.
I invite personally, every student to be an integral and positive part of this great thinking future.
